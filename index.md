## ABOUT ME

Hello! My name is Konstantin Danilyuk. I am a second year student of the Belarusian National Technical University. I'm a software engineer by profession. Also speak English at an pre-intermediate level. I am fond of **self-education** and I think this is the best way to study any science. At university I learn _programming_. 
Here are a few languages that I learned while studying at the university:
```markdown
- C#
- Python
- C++
- Java
```
## INTERESTS

I love to play sports since childhood. Sport helps me to rest my head and put my body in order. I also enjoy watching movies and videos.
